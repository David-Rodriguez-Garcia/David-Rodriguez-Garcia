- 👋 Hi, I’m @David-Rodriguez-Garcia
- 👀 I’m interested in making the world a better place and learning while doing it
- 🌱 I’m currently working on some personal projects, expanding my very poor programming skills and knowledge
- 📚 If you have any advice or information about books, researhes, new and exciting advancements/paths concerning the CS community, please, I beg you tell me
- 💞️ I don't think I have any special skills nor knowledge that are helpful to the community yet, but will not doubt on helping if it's in my power
- 📫 How to reach me (please be considerate with my time, I promise I will do the same 😉) -> davidnichero@gmail.com
